# Gesture-Controlled Linux App

A Linux desktop tool that uses your webcam and hand gestures to trigger actions like shutdown.
Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.


## Scripts

- `main_app.py`: Current app under development — supports multiple gestures and configurable actions.
- `prototype_shutdown.py`: Earlier working prototype — detects fist and triggers shutdown immediately.

## Goals
- Map hand gestures to user-configurable actions
- Run on any Linux system using Docker
- Provide a GUI for gesture-action mapping
